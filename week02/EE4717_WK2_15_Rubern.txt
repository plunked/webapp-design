While learning about HTML tables and CSS is interesting, there definitely can be some improvements to the presentation of the module.
As is, the class is all about coming into class and completing the exercises inside the slides and placing them into the folder.
The exercises are very boring and repetitive. There is effectively zero need to actually be physically present for the module as the process o
completing the exercises and uploading them can be achieved through NTULearn.

The only actually interesting part of the lesson is when we work on the case study using the information we had read about/written about previously.
It might be better provide students with the case study part at the start of the lesson and challenge them to complete it using the information contained in the slides.
This could also be supplemented by using the internet to search for relevant examples. 

It might be more realistic to provide each student with access to a cloud based platform such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS to host the web server. Through this method,
the students are able to not only access the website outside the lab, they would also be able to have exposure to real world platforms.
